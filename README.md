# Game1
Learning how to use objects by creating a text-based adventure game.
This is an attempt to make the environment smart by making
the movement controlls contextually aware/adaptable.

Currently: when walking forward(only), it will atuomatically walk to the end of a hall (or until it reaches a door)

ToDo: 
1) Let user know what's happening: when it stops at a door, let the user know why.
2) Update menu options to be contextually changeable.
3) Make navigation simpler: It should be clear to the user where they are.
