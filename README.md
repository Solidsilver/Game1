# Game1
Learning how to use objects by creating a text-based adventure game.

Currently: when walking forward(only), it will atuomatically walk to the end of a hall (or until it reaches a door)

Done:
1) Let user know what's happening: when it stops at a door, let the user know why.

ToDo: 
1) Update menu options to be contextually changeable.
2) Make navigation simpler: It should be clear to the user where they are.
=======

Current Capabilities: 
1) The game is playable on for one level, and can be beaten.
2) The user is able to exit a partial game, and resume where left off on replay.


ToDo: 
1) Make navigation environmentally aware.
2) Add more levels & (maybe) multi-floor levels.
3) Add more items with different value/purpose.
4) Add creatures to befriend/fight.
5) Add a Storyline/Progression.
